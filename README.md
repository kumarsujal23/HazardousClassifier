 **Cosmic Collision
Analysing Asteroid Risks with Data**

 OVERVIEW
 
 Asteroids are small, rocky objects that orbit the Sun, primarily found in the region between Mars
 and Jupiter known as the asteroid belt. They are remnants from the early solar system, formed
 over 4.6 billion years ago, and are considered planetesimals, or building blocks of planets that
 never coalesced into a larger body due to gravitational disturbances, particularly from Jupiter.
 Asteroid impacts have been a constant force shaping Earth's history. From minor events that
 leave barely a trace to catastrophic collisions that have caused mass extinctions, these cosmic
 encounters have played a significant role in our planet's evolution. Given the potential for
 devastating consequences, scientists worldwide are dedicated to detecting and tracking the
 asteroid impact threat. To mitigate this risk, it is crucial to identify and analyse asteroids that
 could pose a hazard.
 
 **Objective of the Analysis: Data-Driven Classification of Hazardous
 Asteroids**
 
 The primary objective of this analysis is to use data analytics and machine learning techniques
 to determine the likelihood of an asteroid being hazardous to Earth based on various features
 provided in the dataset. This includes examining characteristics such as the asteroid's size,
 orbital parameters, velocity, and proximity to Earth's orbit.
 By analysing these features, the goal is to develop predictive models that classify asteroids into
 hazardous andnon-hazardouscategories. This classification is crucial for prioritising which
 asteroids require further monitoring, potential deflection efforts, or other mitigation strategies.
